<p>Dave is a Senior Software Developer for the NHS Wales Informatics Service, where he spends his time working on health related web applications and maintaining the services they are hosted upon.  Working with ColdFusion and PHP primarily, but currently finding as many excuses as possible to use Node.js.</p>
<p>Outside of his day job he has a wife and three kids taking up most of his spare time.  With what time remains he potters around creating side projects like: an open source CFML engine monitor called CFTracker, a Node.js/MongoDB site monitoring github statistics and currently a secretive little fun project involving more github data.  He also blogs on occasion or contributes to a magazine article here and there.</p>
